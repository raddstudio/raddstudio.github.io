        Greetings!



        Hello World Wide Web, this is another update coming to you with love from Radd Studio 
        Inc. to let you know what we have been up to, and to help us reflect on and celebrate 
        what we have accomplished this past month. 


        I am always trying to find ways to make it work with people, I have a super power and 
        that is seeing what could be, my backup super power is being able to make it happen. 
        I have tried to structure the pricing so that it is as high value and flexible as 
        possible. If you have ever build anything of substance with a team of people, a budget 
        of $15-20k/m is an easy target on a development build. You might have a Project and 
        product managers involved, Front and Back-End developers, web designers and a tester. 
        Much of their time is spent just communicating what they are going to do, and then hope 
        that they do. If you have ever run these teams you have probably seen how quickly it 
        can be akin to herding kittens. Developers will happily dig themselves into a rabbit 
        hole if you leave them to their own devices.  Flow is great, the art comes in directing 
        that flow in a direction that serves the mission as often as possible (seems like this 
        is a constant focus of attention to keeping a fluid remote team).  
        

        Introducing Growth for Support, as you know, we have basic tiers that we offer our 
        services in, Support, Growth, and Innovate, at 1h/3h/10h per day respectively for a 
        month. Support is mainly a process role, we help you feed the team tasks so that they 
        stay productive and serve the mission as best they can. Growth takes on some hands on 
        work as needed to remove barriers and create new opportunities for the product, that 
        can mean any number of tasks, but with 15h a week there is actually some time to get 
        some coding done compared to only 5h..The Innovate tier is designed to be 2h / day with 
        a fractional and 2 slots of 4h of any number of resources needed to deploy a growth 
        strategy. Sales, Marketing, Social, Tech, Ops, Legal, Creative fractionals can be at 
        the helm for the month having up to two weekly scoped resources to attack whatever is 
        ailing your buisiness. How do we fill those 4h slots? We have a company that we are 
        working with who provide those services ala cart by the week and we work with them to 
        get whatever is needed for your Go-To-Market strategy, done.   So what is Growth for 
        Support? Using the FAST agreement, you can supersize your Support tier to use the 5h a 
        week to accomplish things that you would do in Growth tier. Being subsidised by the FAST 
        agreement, its a great way to get a little more with a little less that you normally 
        would need to make it happen! The offer is only good for the 4 months, hopefully in that 
        time we can make something that you can start testing with real life customers and making 
        your first revenues asap. With some revenues or investments hopefully by then client can 
        stay at support, and we continue to drive process with them through a growing team (in 
        best case scenarios) or we can move it up to Growth or Innovate tiers to make it happen 
        without needing to hire anyone else.   At any time customers can turn down their monthly 
        commitment to us to once a month success calls, so there is no long term commitment to 
        a massive dev bill. Keep us in your corner us for as little as $250/m or go all in on 
        the Innovate tier we will your grow your product offering rapidly in the next 3 months


        Some of the biggest news this month to announce is the end of the Founder Institute Fall 
        2023 Toronto Core Program. Lots of really great connections have been made through LinkedIn 
        and there are tons of them that I have yet to get to. I am trying to be a little more 
        personal with my work these days and so it takes a little more time that I am only recently 
        becoming more accustom to accepting as a default. 


        One thing that I have been putting off that is tasked to us by is to reach out to advisors 
        to your company. An amazing asset that FI introduces is the FAST agreement, or the Founder 
        Advisor Standard Template that scaffolds how the two can test a working relationship, and 
        defines what the expectations are of time and resources. Its Great, you can check it out at 
        raddstudio.com/agreements/fast.pdf  I have a list of 10 people asking if they will commit 
        5h to 10h per week for 2 years for equity in the company as Radd Studio’s advisor board. So, 
        what did we do? We have made advancements on four products, and started to bootstrap activities 
        around social media strategies. Now that we have a client MVP to keep the machine oiled up, 
        we have a lot of work to do to bootstrap 3 of our own products and also do our best to make 
        the most with a little on a client build. 


        If you’re listening still, thank you so much for putting up with me, im still kind of getting 
        used to this, I hope the audio is a little better from last month, the good things will compound 
        quickly this month, I have been investing a lot into hopefully the right things. I am excited 
        to find out what I will be announcing next month!   If you like to follow journeys from scratch, 
        you will want to join this one. We are trying to build community without leaning too much on 
        past communities. We know what’s mertiable. Merit and we’ve been focused on it this past year. 
          Subscribe, follow, likes, tell your friends about us who want to build something, and we will 
        never forget it. 



          Stay Tuned!

        That was a lot, I can't believe you made it all the way here.  Thank you for taking 
        the time to read this first of many investor updates. 


            "Don't let the fear of the time it will take to accomplish something 
             stand in the way of your doing it. The time will pass anyway; we might 
             just as well put that passing time to the best possible use."

                - Earl Nightingale


        Many more good things to come. Happy Holidays and have an amazing 2024.


        Cheers!

        Are you developing an MVP?  Or running a Tech team without leadership?  Often times 
        with some small process implementation and/or improvements, you can make the 
        experience better for product owners & developers alike.  That's just good for 
        business.
