        Greetings!



        I have been quiet this year. 

        Its been a lot of reflection.  Of what transpired, and what to do next.

        At the beginning of the 2023, I was essentially left with no choice but to strip my 
        life of everything.  I've been on an epic quest all my life to build an empire with 
        only a pursuit knowledge and the faith in my abilities to deliver there to guide me. 
        I know that my time is valuable, and my learning this year has been that I need to 
        own that value if I expect it to succeed. With ailing parents, grandparents, and 
        friends falling from the map..  I couldn't serve that mission anymore.  It was a lot 
        of change, all at once.  Despite knowing how much I would be giving up, it was the 
        right thing to do, so I did.


            “Don’t cling to a mistake just because you spent a lot of time making it.”
               
               ― Aubrey de Grey


        Up until this year, I have always expected that I would share the duties of owning 
        the business with someone.  Companies are rarely founded solo, and so my search for 
        many years has been to seek out partnerships with ambitious people who want to build 
        something.  What I was building wasn't ever 100% mine.  I owned the product, but the 
        mission belonged to an "us".

        While I've found it so that many people want the title, and the money.  Without the 
        discipline and dedication to achieve what we are seeking to achieve there is no 
        chance.  Busy is not productive.  The data reveals the truths.  You can't know until 
        you've tried.  While I am still seeking founders and advisors for my endeavours, now 
        I am dedicated to leaving this year with, at least, what I entered it.  While it 
        drained me in almost every way imaginable, I was emotionally attached to our mission 
        while remaining blind to the red flags.  It's good to trust your partners, it's not 
        good to go and leave them unchecked.

        I haven't been paid a salary since June 2016.  Bootstrapping with small builds, and 
        some basic expenses covered, I know now that I could work myself to death.  I easily 
        did 8 years of 40h weeks over the 260 weeks building my last company.  Commuting to 
        the office often left me without enough to eat that day, in a country that wasn't my 
        home.  Without the means to travel or a steady visa, it became evident that it was 
        no longer something any self respecting person should continue to accept.

        I respect myself, it was hard to leave something that I had spent the past 5 years 
        conjuring it out from nothing, but it was the right thing to do.  I have spent this 
        year rekindling time with friends and family, and rebuilding; not restarting, but 
        continuing from where I left off.  I entered the year with three properties, and I 
        will leave it with three properties.  These are what we have to announce today.



        1. Packkit List     - The Essentials Checklist
        2. Click Studio     - Email Marketing Automatons - YOU ARE HERE
        3. Time Bank        - A Project Management tool for your Crews and their Time Bank
        4. Nomad Camp       - Journey Roadmap 
                              - You Are The Product for solopreneurs + digital nomads
        5. Radd Studio Inc. - Leadership as a Service 
                              - Fractional Leadership for solopreneurs + digital nomads



        I am doing now, what I should have done 15 years ago and just put out my own 
        products.  They are early.  I will make incremental improvements to each one 
        regularly, and as an influx of revenues come in, the market will decide what they 
        "are".  These are properties, with an initial concept, delivering on a value or 
        delivering a service, and is connected to Stripe. 



        Accolades from this year: 
        -------------------------


        1. Joined Founder Institute - who have helped me remain accountable to a proven 
        system of developing tech companies and have helped align me with mentors, legal 
        experts, and tons of other really awesome people who are ultimately seeking to build 
        MVPs.  A network of ideal clients, partners, and colleagues.  I have had a steady 
        growth up to 4000 connections on Linkedin, and have 3-5 meetings a week speaking to 
        potential founder/cofounding roles and making appearances to weekly workshops.

        DONE: 
        - Vision & Mission, Customer Development, Revenue & Business Models, Pitch Mastery, 
        - Mentor Review, Legal & Equity, Go-To-Market & Scale, Product Development

        NEXT: 
        - Cofounders & Team, Growth, Investor Pitch Review, Equity & Funding, Graduation

        BONUSES:
        - 30% off for 4 months, good until end of January - 2023 Fall Toronto Core Program

        - 10% off for first 4 months - FI Alumni

        2. Founded Radd Studio Inc. - in July officially, again, something that I immaturely 
        held off on and it has no doubt cost me over the years.  It's done, and I am doing 
        the things I've lamented doing in that vein.  The fundamentals are being laid and 
        from this we will build a development studio as it always should have been.

        Radd Studio started as a personal brand in 2007 when I bought the dot com.  It has 
        become my personal consulting practice for the years, though it hasn't gotten the 
        treatment it deserves.  A tale like the cobbler with no shoes, I am evolving it once 
        more to scale across other leaders in different roles, I believe that with remote 
        work and fractional leaders coming into abundance, we are going to see a crazy shift 
        in how companies are built.  It is adapting to attach itself to that as an industry 
        leader building a mesh network of fractional and product owners in an equity 
        collective.

        Radd Studio Inc. is the IP owner of PKL, CS, & TB @ 20% of each. with more to come 
        every year. Investing in RaddStudio means a cut in of all the studio's products.

        https://raddstudio.com

        DONE: 
        - Incorporation, Fundamentals, Stripe, Web, Offerings

        NEXT: 
        - Resign the homepage to include advancements in Products and Services

        3. Relaunched Packkit List - in 2017, while on remote year, we did a 7 week startup. 
        The challenge was to essentially lay the foundations for each vertical in business, 
        and then take the MVP to sale on the 7th.  It was great, until day 7, when it came 
        to selling it, it was back to building for someone else.

        Packkit List is really simple for the Basic users, build a list, that list can be
        connected to different APIs and complete orders to them, think grocery service 
        aggregation, or a set of Every Day Carry items that is directly connected to amazon, 
        images, titles, with our affiliate links in case they go to buy from amazon directly.

        For Pro users there is access to a marketplace of curated lists, you can go and 
        explore different sets of products that have been coordinated by its users.  You can 
        one click buy the list, or exclude/replace items before you buy them.  Save the 
        lists to your profile, and also collect a fee if you are the curator of the sold 
        list!

        Launching for limited time (first 100) @ $149 one-time fee Lifetime License, reg 
        price will be modeled at $15/m, $150/y, and $250 reg. lifetime.

        https://packkitlist.com
        https://packkitl.ist

        DONE: 
        - Domain, Email, Initial Landing Page
        - MVP Application providing UI for building lists of different types

        NEXT: 
        - Amazon API has changed their policy since 2017. Need to deploy a content strategy. 
        - List building contests to attract signups and curated lists for the marketplace.

        4. Launched Click Studio - This year when seeking what to do next, there was plenty 
        of job hunting and it occurred to me that there are a lot of little products needed 
        to develop and effective go to market strategy.  Email lists seem to be the most 
        essential role id developing a successful online strategy.  if you look at what the 
        people making 6 figures are doing, its not hard to see how its done.

        These products, while are really effective, are relatively simple to deliver.  I 
        could probably be spending $200-500 per month getting the functionality and value 
        from what I have delivered here in this first phase of release.

        - Articles + Landings: content pages that can be linked to affiliate APIs;
        - Call to Actions: simple, leading to a Whitelist or a price table
        - Surveys + Polls: create and embedd anywhere on the web
        - Customers + Clicks: a dashboard to for their activity

        Launching for a limited time (first 100) @ $149 one-time fee Lifetime License, reg. 
        price will be modeled $12/m or $120/y per vertical, and all 3 for $30/m or $300/y, 
        and $750 reg. lifetime.

        https://clickstudio.email

        DONE: 
        - MVP of Articles, Landings, Actions, Surveys, Polls, Customers, Clicks, Users

        Send inquiries to: click@raddstudio.com



        5. Launching Pilot of TimeBank - one thing that you learn when building products is 
        to listen for the pain points, in a recent conversation it came to my realization 
        that there is still a labor intensive process that still goes on in industries that 
        haven't necessarily advanced much in some ways.

        TimeBank allows operations managers to interact with their crews remotely, 
        scheduling their projects by location and scope, create crews, and assign crews to 
        projects.

        Crew members have a very simple dashboard for Today, including a scope and schedule 
        for the project, the crew members with you on the job, the location, expected start 
        and end times.  Your crew can check-in and out of the day, or flag themselves as "on 
        the way", etc.  Before payday, crew can set how many hours they would like to"bank",
        for the rest to be paid out.

        TimeBank will deliver monthly reports for approval and to pass off to the accounting 
        teams to handle existing administrative process.  Or, you can pay them directly 
        though Stripe.

        *This is currently running on a free service, I will level up the resources before 
        the first pilot.

        Launching with a pricing model of $25/manager + $10/person/month

        https://timebank.onrender.com

        DONE: 
        - Manager, Projects, Crews, and People Dashboards

        NEXT: 
        - Check In & Out, Bank Clock, Report

        SEEKING:
        - 5 Pilot Companies for MVP @ 50% off for two years
        - Investment: %1 for US$10,000 up to 5% max out of 10% of 10,000 shares

        Send inquiries to: timebank@raddstudio.com



        6. Kickoff w/first MVP client as Radd Studio Inc. - introducing Gritty - a coaching 
        product geared towards building mental toughness for up and coming youth hockey 
        players.  This is a massive help, this will bring in the revenue needed to take the 
        next steps in the go to market strategy.  Access to AI services, AWS, Google, etc 
        don't come cheap! Gerald is also an amazing designer and will no doubt leave his 
        mark on the branding of all our products.  We are grateful for that!



        -
        As we come to a close to the year, we are starting to focus more on building out the 
        community through content strategies.  Now that the foundations are present for 
        handing users and closing the loop of revenue; a series well played marketing 
        campaign can change quickly make these sustainable products.

        Are you developing an MVP?  Or running a Tech team without leadership?  Often times 
        with some small process implementation and/or improvements, you can make the 
        experience better for product owners & developers alike.  That's just good for 
        business.
